In the last nine months of planning the **[Contact Summit][12]**, I’ve come 
across a range of projects and initiatives building toward the “[Next Net.][13]” 
Though they vary in their stages of development and specific implementations, 
they fall under the common themes of enabling peer-to-peer communication and 
exchange, protecting personal freedom and privacy, and giving people more control 
over their data and identity on the web. Here’s list of just ten projects, 
many of which will be demoing at our exhibitor space at Contact on October 
20th in New York City.

**1. [The Locker Project][14]**

![][15]

The data that we generate on the web every day is being collected, stored and 
sold by third parties, but we are left unable to benefit from that value we 
create. The Locker Project is making it possible for people to access and aggregate 
their own personal data, so they can exchange and leverage it in valuable ways. 

**What it means:** Step 1 is to create the lockers that allow people to collect 
all their data in one resource. Step 2 is to enable application developers 
to build products on top of that personal data, creating a whole new data marketplace. 

**2. [Commotion Wireless Project][16]**

![][17]

Commotion aims to build a new type of tool for democratic organizing: an open 
source “device-as-infrastructure” distributed communications platform that 
integrates users’ existing cell phones, WiFi-enabled computers, and other WiFi-capable 
personal devices to create a metro-scale peer-to-peer (mesh) communications 
network.

**What it means:** Democratic activists around the globe will gain access to 
a secure and reliable platform to ensure their communications cannot be controlled 
or cut off by authoritarian regimes.

**3. [Lantern][18]**

![][19]

Lantern is a globally cooperative censorship circumvention tool build on the 
Little Shoot peer-to-peer platform. It lets people living in relatively uncensored 
countries to donate a small part of their bandwidth to help people living under 
censorship gain access to the open internet.

**What it means:** Kind of like how [SETI@home][20] lets you help search for 
extraterrestrial life, Lantern lets you contribute your computing power to 
solve global censorship.

**4. [FreedomBox][21]**

![][22]

‘The FreedomBox is a project that combines the computing power of a smart phone 
with your wireless router to create a network of personal servers to protect 
privacy during daily life, maintain beachheads of free network access during 
times of political instability, and open lines of communication during natural 
disasters’.

**What it means:** Privacy protection from snooping governments, billionaires, 
thugs or gossipy neighbors. Anonymous communication, encrypted email, and resistance 
to internet shutdown included.

**5. [Diaspora][23]**

![][24]

Diaspora aims to be a distributed network, where computers can connect to each 
other directly without surrendering privacy. Their mission is to build a social 
web that’s 100% owned and controlled by its users.

**What it means:** If you’re tired of privacy policy changes on Facebook or 
social networks selling your information to advertisers, you can switch to 
a place where you own your own data and it’s easy to share what you want with 
whom.

**6. [Project Byzantium][25]**

![][26]

Project Byzantium aims to develop a communication system by which users can 
connect to each other and share information in the absence of convenient access 
to the Internet. Their current approach is to investigate existing technologies 
that could support this system, such as mesh networking protocols, wireless 
networking technologies, and decentralized alternatives to internet addressing/naming 
systems such as DNS.

**What it means:** According to project wiki, this system would be useful if 
the internet became unavailable due to natural disaster, shutdown from central 
authority, or as a result of a zombie apocalypse.

**7. [Metacurrency Project][27]**

![][28]

In our information economy, we need tools other than money that can help to 
guide the flows of our attention, trust, participation and value. The Metacurrency 
Project is developing the technology tools, protocols and platforms that will 
enable people to interact and transact directly with each other, beyond centralized 
control.

**What it means:** As new currencies and ways to measure and acknowledge value 
emerge, we’ll want ways for them to interact. Metacurrency aims to enable that 
interoperability.

**8. [Tor Project][29]**

![][30]

‘Tor is free software and an open network that help you defend against a form 
of network surveillance ta threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential 
business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic 
analysis. It protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed 
network of relays run by volunteers all around the world.’

**What it means:** Use Tor to prevent anyone from learning your location or 
browsing habits.

**9. [Bitcoin][31]**

![][32]

‘Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments 
to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate 
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried 
out[ collectively by the network][33]. Bitcoin is also the name of the open 
source software which enables the use of this currency.’

**What it means:** Bitcoin is an experiment to create a decentralized free 
monetary system that is frictionless, can process micropayments, and where 
transaction costs are driven to zero.

**10. [Community Forge][34]**

![][35]

Using a LETS architecture coded into a Drupal platform, Community Forge enables 
real-world and virtual communities to use mutual credit currencies to build 
towards a more sustainable economy.

**What it means:** This open source mutual credit software, ideal for LETS 
and Time Banking communities, enables community members to express their wants 
and haves, and to begin exchanging value without the need of money.

**Three bonus projects to watch:**

**11. [MeshKit Bonfire][36]**

![][37]

MeshKit is a social networking toolkit for building self-sustaining , ad-hoc 
and static wireless mesh communities, through intrinsic social gaming and a 
peer to peer economy. The aim is to meet the social goals of creating a community 
of reciprocity, trust and interdependence, while extending the community’s 
need for a mesh beyond the decentralized value.

**What it means:** Just like starting a community garden serves the purpose 
of providing food while fulfilling greater social aims of bringing people together, 
the Meshkit is an attempt to do the same thing, but with wireless mesh communities 
instead of gardens. So, should the internet get knocked out, you’ve got both 
a community of friends and a backup plan.

**12. [Free Network Foundation][38]**

![][39]

Member of the FNF believe access to a free network is a human right and necessary 
tool for environment and social justice. Their vision is to steward a cooperatively 
owned global communications infrastructure that is immune to censorship and 
resistant to breakdown.

**What it means:** Instead of paying an Internet Service Provider, a local 
community would essentially form a co-op to own and operate their share of 
the network.

**13. [Connect.me][40]**

![][41]

[Connect.me][40] is a social vouching system for the web. It enables you to 
share your reputation, get recognized for your skills and passions, and demonstrate 
your expertise. By vouching for the people you respect, a stronger layer of 
trust on the web can emerge.

**What it means:** Instead of relying on an algorithm to make recommendations 
for who to follow and why, we rely on each other to develop a web of trust 
and reputation that each of us can stand behind.

update: I almost forgot….. this long list of P2P Infrastructure projects is 
being maintained by the P2P Foundation - http://p2pfoundation.net/Category:P2P_Infrastructure 

——

This list is by no means exhaustive, but gives a taste to the amount of activity 
and passion fueling new innovations in the net infrastructure. Our goal with 
the [Contact Summit][12] is to highlight the [many p2p projects][42] out there, 
spanning domains like business and social commerce, technology and society, 
government, learning, and the arts. We want to show that while it’s true that 
many of our traditional institutions are crumbling, there are plenty of inspiring 
examples of what comes next. We’re entering a new phase of humanity where, 
indeed, the Evolution will be Social!
