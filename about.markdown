Welcome fellow travelers, visionaries, and agents of change!

This is a blog exploring the co-evolution of humanity and our technologies.

I started writing here back in 2009 while I was working on my MA in Media Studies at the New School in NYC. My passion has been in watching what is happening at the intersection of technology, communication and culture – how people are using the web and peer-to-peer technology to more effectively self-organize, collaborate, build community, and accelerate social innovation.

I feel that we are a global society in transition. Many of our traditional institutions are failing or just broken. The narrative is broken. The idea of ‘us verse them’ doesn’t work when the realization is made that we are all co-existing in an interdependent set of systems. We are now in the process of telling a new story about how civilization can function in a way that incorporates sustainable practices and leads to resilient and thrivable societies.

New models are being created for open collaboration and open enterprise, for complementary and alternative currencies, for governance, and for spirituality and empowerment. These experiments are inspirational and give me hope that we are reaching the tipping point where a critical mass of people on this planet (much less than I would have thought was necessary) are waking up to our true potential as a globally networked consciousness.

I am scouting the edges of technology and innovation, right where the magic happens.

Thanks for joining me on the journey. Below is a bit more about what I’m up to.

Here are a few projects I’ve been working on:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1865" title="Screen shot 2011-05-10 at 11.26.41 AM" src="http://technologybubbles.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/screen-shot-2011-05-10-at-11-26-41-am.png?w=600" alt="" />](http://technologybubbles.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/screen-shot-2011-05-10-at-11-26-41-am.png)

Here’s a visual resume I made a few years back. It’s due for an update, but gives a general overview of what I’ve been up to. (click to enlarge):

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-667" title="visual_resume" src="http://technologybubbles.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/visual_resume.jpg?w=600&amp;h=768" alt="" width="600" height="768" />](http://technologybubbles.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/visual_resume.jpg)

At the moment, I’m navigating myself through the murky waters of entrepreneurship and building a business around my passions. I am working with a globally distributed network of collaborators – artists, designers, thinkers, developers – to assist mission-driven organizations in spreading their messages, building movements, and impacting positive change.
