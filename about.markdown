Welcome fellow travelers, visionaries, and agents of change!

This is a blog exploring the co-evolution of humanity and our technologies. 

I started writing here back in 2009 while I was working on my MA in Media Studies 
at the New School in NYC. My passion has been in watching what is happening 
at the intersection of technology, communication and culture – how people are 
using the web and peer-to-peer technology to more effectively self-organize, 
collaborate, build community, and accelerate social innovation.

I feel that we are a global society in transition. Many of our traditional 
institutions are failing or just broken. The narrative is broken. The idea 
of ‘us verse them’ doesn’t work when the realization is made that we are all 
co-existing in an interdependent set of systems. We are now in the process 
of telling a new story about how civilization can function in a way that incorporates 
sustainable practices and leads to resilient and thrivable societies.

New models are being created for open collaboration and open enterprise, for 
complementary and alternative currencies, for governance, and for spirituality 
and empowerment. These experiments are inspirational and give me hope that 
we are reaching the tipping point where a critical mass of people on this planet 
(much less than I would have thought was necessary) are waking up to our true 
potential as a globally networked consciousness.

I am scouting the edges of technology and innovation, right where the magic 
happens.

Thanks for joining me on the journey. Below is a bit more about what I’m up 
to.

Here are a few projects I’ve been working on:

[![][4]][5]

[Contact Conference][6] – I’m Executive Director for this event, coming up 
in NYC Oct 20, 2011. We’re bringing together the people building the new p2p 
global paradigm .

[Earth Dashboard][7] – I am an Advisor on this project, a multimedia real-time 
display that will be installed at the United Nations Headquarters in NYC.

[Open Foresight][8] – This is a methodology I’m developing with friend & collaborator 
Alvis Brigis, to enable better ways to build knowledge and visions of the future 
together.

[Future of Facebook Project][9] – This is the first Open Foresight project 
we’re currently working on – a 6 part video series to explore the future of 
this social media juggernaut.

[Future of Money Project][10] – This was a video I co-produced for a speaking 
event I did last Fall at [SIBOS in Amsterdam][11]. It got picked up in [Forbes][12], 
[Huffington Post][13], and [Fast Company][14].

[Foresight Education & Research Network][15] – I’m a Director for this initiative 
to spread “futures thinking” and foresight education into the mainstream.

[Junto][16] – This was a project to launch a video-based discussion/collaboration/action 
network. Still trying to figure this one out.

[Nokia Ideas Project ][17]- I was invited to share my thoughts about the future 
of the web/communications on Nokia’s site. Here’s a clip:

I also do guest posts on other blogs occasionally. Below are a few places you’ll 
find my work, like Georgetown University’s peer-reviewed journal [gnovis][18], [SpaceCollective][19], [socialmediatoday][20], [unstrucuture][21], [grow][22], [Blogging 
Innovation][23], [Media Rights][24], and [MemeBox][25]. Most recently my writing 
was featured on [CNN.com][26].

I’ve also been asked to speak at various conferences & workshops. Here’s a 
few:

- [Social Business Edge][29], ‘Designing a Culture of Collaboration’ NYC 4/19/2010 

- [SIBOS][11], ‘The Future of Money’, Amsterdam 10/25/2010

- [Neue Digital/Razorfish][30], ‘Beyond the Browser: Digital Media Trends’, 
Berlin 12/17/2010

- [SOFA][31], ‘A Superfluid Economy’, NYC 3/9/2011

- [Innotribe Mumbai][32], ‘Mobile Payments: Connecting the unbanked’, Mumbai 
6/1/2011

- [Amplify Festival][33] [upcoming], Sydney 6/6/2011

Here’s a visual resume I made a few years back. It’s due for an update, but 
gives a general overview of what I’ve been up to. (click to enlarge):

At the moment, I’m navigating myself through the murky waters of entrepreneurship 
and building a business around my passions. I am working with a globally distributed 
network of collaborators – artists, designers, thinkers, developers – to assist 
mission-driven organizations in spreading their messages, building movements, 
and impacting positive change.
